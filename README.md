In this project, I am using JS, HTML, and CSS to build a simple shop page with some features such as displaying products, and carts.
With the cart feature, you can add a product to the cart with some basic modifiers like remove, increase, and decrease items.
With display products, you can filter with some functions such as searching by name, choosing a specific company of product that you want to find, and arranging product price as well.
